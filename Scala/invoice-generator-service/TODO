- Review the code
  -- Introduce InvoiceService, avoid calling repositories directly
  -- Split InvoiceApi into InvoiceEndpoints, InvoiceServer
- Run the service locally, feed some events, observe their handling
- Run tests locally
- The API should also have endpoints to fetch the invoice's PDF when given the invoice id
- Add the missing tests (i.e. for Repository)
- Deploy the service to GCP, feed some events, observe their handling
- Add OpenTelemetry and tracing, update the development instructions correspondingly
