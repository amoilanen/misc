- There should be no separate "Remove from collection" button for a Bookmark in a collection
- Add to collection dialog should also allow to add to the "Ungrouped" collection

- Clicking on the bookmark in the file editor should remove it

- Deleting a collection should delete also all the bookmarks in the collection
  -- Collection deletion if it contains more than one bookmark should require a confirmation

- For every bookmark in the Bookmarks view there should be a delete icon on hover to delete the bookmark immediately from this view

- Use icons instead of the bulky text "Create collection", "Delete collection", "Add Bookmark to Collection" etc. The text might still be in the tooltips

- Adding a bookmark to a collection should keep the expanded state of the Collections and Bookmarks (i.e. expanded or collapsed) in the Bookmarks view
