- Adding a bookmark to a collection should keep the expanded state of the Collections and Bookmarks (i.e. expanded or collapsed) in the Bookmarks view

- Add to collection dialog should also allow to add to the "Ungrouped" collection

- Clicking on the bookmark in the file editor should remove it

- Collapse/expand button for the whole tree of bookmarks
- Settings should open the extension settings

- Do not show the notification "Bookmark added at line", it is already obvious from the visual appearance
- It should be possible to add a description to every bookmark either in the editor on the Bookmark view, this description is shown when hovering over the bookmark
