- Review existing code
- Also the existing PR comments should be provided as a context to LLM
- Implement support for actions ResolveThread, ReplyInThread which can be used by LLM
- Run the app locally and make sure that it posts correct comments when a PR review is needed
  -- Test pushing subsequent updates to the PR (empty updates), the reviewer should not leave duplicate comments (existing comments should be provided in the initial prompt to LLM)
  -- Test addressing PR comments, reviewer should be able to resolve the comments
- Deploy the app to AWS and test is there

- Instead of a local configuration with hardcoded repos there should be a database and an admin interface where repos to watch can be added together with the models to use
